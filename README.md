## CA-ToMe for Stable Diffusion 🚀🎨

![How we apply caching to token merging](https://github.com/omidiu/ca_tome/raw/main/statics/graphical_abstract.png)

Cached Adaptive Token Merging (**CA-ToMe**) combines two techniques to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy in diffusion models. 🌟 

- **Adaptive Token Merging**: Merges redundant tokens based on their similarity at each step, controlled by a threshold. 🔗 
- **Caching Mechanism**: Leverages temporal redundancy by storing similar pairs across adjacent steps. 🔐 

This training-free method achieves a speedup factor of **1.24x** during the denoising process while maintaining the same FID scores as existing approaches. 💡  
It can be applied to any diffusion model with transformer blocks, including Stable Diffusion models from the Diffusers library. 🛠️

## Results 📊

### Performance without Caching ⚡
Here are the results of **time (seconds)** and [FID](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) for different thresholds using Stable Diffusion v1.5 on a V100 GPU with 50 PLMS steps:

| Method                      | T  | FID ↓  | Time (s/im) ↓            |
|-----------------------------|----|:------|:--------------------------|
| **Baseline (Original Model)** | 1.0 | 34.23 | 7.51                      |
| **(w/Adaptive Merging)**     | 0.9 | 33.42 | 6.92 (**1.08x** _faster_) |
|                             | 0.8 | 33.80 | 6.58 (**1.14x** _faster_) |
|                             | 0.7 | 34.30 | 6.23 (**1.20x** _faster_) |
|                             | 0.6 | 35.56 | 6.10 (**1.23x** _faster_) |
|                             | 0.5 | 35.46 | 6.07 (**1.23x** _faster_) |
|                             | 0.4 | 35.28 | 6.07 (**1.23x** _faster_) |

## Installation 🛠️
```bash
pip install ca-tome
```

---

## Usage 🚀
```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
from ca_tome import apply_CA_ToMe, CacheConf

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
    cache_dir="model"
).to("cuda")

apply_CA_ToMe(pipe=pipe, cache_conf=CacheConf.CONFIG_3, r=0.8)

image = pipe.call("A high quality photograph of a cat").images[0]
image.save("cat.png")
```

🔔 **Note**: All experiments were conducted on the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model, which is no longer supported on Hugging Face. Instead, we are using a mirror of the deprecated runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 model.
